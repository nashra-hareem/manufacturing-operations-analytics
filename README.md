Manufacturing operations and inventory analysis to support operational decision-making.
# Manufacturing Analytics Suite

## Executive Overview

The **Manufacturing Analytics Suite** is a focused Power BI solution designed to monitor production efficiency, material utilization, and quality performance across manufacturing departments.

Built on operational production data, this dashboard provides real-time visibility into output, wastage, and employee-level performance — enabling faster, data-driven decisions that improve throughput and reduce losses on the shop floor.

The solution centers on three core analytical areas:
- Production Output & Efficiency  
- Quality & Rejection Analysis  
- Department & Employee Performance  

Each visual is designed to surface operational bottlenecks, quality risks, and opportunities for continuous process improvement.

## Dashboard Sections

### 1. Production Output & Efficiency

**Purpose**  
Provide a high-level snapshot of production volume and material flow across the manufacturing process.

**Key Features**
- Manufactured Quantity: total units produced  
- Processed Quantity: units successfully cleared after quality checks  
- Wastage Percentage: critical KPI tracking material loss  
- Department-level output comparison (e.g., Woven Labels vs Printed Labels)  

**Business Value**  
Helps production managers monitor throughput, identify underperforming lines, and ensure output aligns with operational targets.

---

### 2. Quality & Rejection Analysis

**Purpose**  
Evaluate product quality and identify where defects and rejections occur.

**Key Features**
- Total rejected quantity  
- Employee-wise rejection breakdown  
- Department-level rejection trends  
- Wastage impact linked to rejection volume  

**Business Value**  
Supports quality teams in pinpointing root causes, reducing defects, and improving first-pass yield.

---

### 3. Department & Employee Performance

**Purpose**  
Understand how teams and operators contribute to production efficiency and quality outcomes.

**Key Features**
- Department output comparison  
- Employee-level rejection metrics  
- Time-filtered performance analysis  

**Business Value**  
Enables supervisors to optimize staffing, improve training programs, and reward high-performing teams while addressing process gaps.
